        > changed makefile to -O1 flag, runs about 15% faster than -O3
        > removed getIndex function dependency
            - this was a simple math ops that was called massive amounts
              of times (soaked up ~40% of runtime according to gprof)

    OPTIMIZATION 1: 8x faster than base code
        > Bit operations + store neighbor count in every cell
            -added typedef cellType to quickly change type stored
                + char performed quite a bit better than int
            - removed malloc on every turn, simply keep around a tempBoard that is
                malloc-ed in init, free when program exits (reduced memory use significantly)
                + this was found when testing 4k x 4k took significantly longer than expected
                with massive system time according to fish shell time command

Thoughts: 
    NOT APPLIED:
    0. SHORT CIRCUIT
    test files are simply 1 oscilator, this could be exploited

    (kinda cheating based on the test files, will NOT be doing this)
    taking pages from chess engine transposition table:
    - keep list of live cells coords, compute next generation and put both
        into a hash table
    - if current generation found in hash table, retrieve future gen state
        - short circuit: if turn%2 = iters%2,
            check if future gen is in hash table and will result in current gen
            if yes: end the game immediately, we know its a loop and game will
            end exactly as it is now
    - prohibitive memory consumption if we are running a real GOL
    - all games will end in after turn 2, will be very fast (but again, cheaty?)


    1. bit operations & memory (APPLIED)
    - every cell is a char for minimum memory
        - bit 0 (right most) keeps track if cell is alive, 1 if alive
        - bit 3-1 keeps track of neighbor count
            - >>1 on a cell would yield neighbor count immediately,
            allowing fast neighbor count check
        - if a cell is toggled to be alive, add 2 to surrounding cells
            - sub 2 if live cell dies
        - can directly compare cell to 0 (no neighbor and dead) to skip computations
    
    2. only consider living cells and neighbors
    - keep hash table of coords to living cells and their neighbors
    - only update these cells, we only consider 15 cells every round for
    these test files
    - might consume lots of memory on real simulations? (nvm i realized max
    mem consumtion is 2 times keeping 1 single board)
    - i didnt use this because i didnt want to use a lib or implement a table

    3. threading (APPLIED)
    - make a function that only update nth row on a new table
    - use a thread pool to handle row checks
    - each thread must be working a row thats is at least 2 rows away from another
    thread to avoid race conditions (each cell update may adjust row above or below)
    - ALT: all threads only queue cellOn/cellOff tasks
        when finished tasks are excecuted by the main thread
        no mutex lock needed or avoiding race con
